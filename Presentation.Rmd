# Introduction (Witlie)

# Motivation (Neha)

- Investigating heart failure, a condition impacting millions worldwide, and exploring its complex causes and contributing factors.

- Spotting patterns between risk factors and how heart failure progresses to get a better understanding.


# Linearity and Normality (Neha)


# Logistic Regression (Witlie)


# SVM (Paige)

- Predicting Death Event 
- Like our Linear Regression methods we began by splitting the data into training and test data. 
- I began by assessing the support variables and determining the acurracy of the model. 

# Random Forest (paige)



# Results (Paige)
