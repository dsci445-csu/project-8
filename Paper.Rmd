# Motivation

The goal of our project is to predict mortality from heart failure using behavioral risk factor data.

# Methodology

#### Exploratory Analysis 

assessing linearity and normality of variables

#### Logistic Regression with Regularization

Logistic Regression is designed inherently for binary classification problems such as ours. 

1. Logistic Regression model with no regularization

Does not address any potential collinearity issues or irrelevant predictors (mostly doing just to act as a reference to compare with Ridge & Lasso)

2. Logistic Regression model with Ridge Regression

Penalizes large coefficients, stabilizing the model. Does not get rid of any predictors. Interpretability is worse than with Lasso. Addresses collinearity & irrelevant predictors.

3. Logistic Regression model with Lasso

Performs feature selection by driving certain coefficients to zero. Better interpretability than Ridge. Addresses collinearity & irrelevant predictors.

Analysis: Compare predictive strength of each of these 3 models and determine best

#### Support Vector Machine

Can handle linear and non-linear decision boundaries. Using a linear kernel is good for approximately linear relationships (which it seems like our data is). Does not assume any specific distribution of predictors (which is good because none of our predictors are normal) 



#### Random Forest

Does not assume linear or nonlinear relationship between predictors and response. Good for non-normal variables.

#### Assessment

Compare the results of Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest
