# Motivation

The goal of our project is to predict mortality from heart failure using behavioral risk factor data.

# Methodology

#### Exploratory Analysis 

assessing linearity and normality of variables

#### Regularization 

Lasso or Ridge regression? 

Investigate individual significance of variables -> many variables do not display significance

Perform both Ridge & Lasso and compare results.

#### Model creation


#### Assessment


# Results
