To determine which regularization method would be most appropriate, will investigate significance of each predictor variable.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv")

# scale continuous variables
numeric_vars <- sapply(data, is.numeric)
boolean_vars <- sapply(data, function(x) all(x %in% c(0,1)))

need_scale <- numeric_vars & !boolean_vars

data[need_scale] <- scale(data[need_scale])
```

Now check to see how many variables display significance

```{r}
# linear regression model
lin_reg_model <- lm(DEATH_EVENT ~ ., data = data)

summary(lin_reg_model)
```

It looks like there are quite a few predictors that do not display a significant correlation with the response. Ridge regression seems most appropriate. Will do both ridge regression and lasso and compare 

```{r}

```
