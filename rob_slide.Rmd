## Method: Elastic Net

- Reminder:
Elastic Net is a shrinkage model that combines LASSO and Ridge Regression penalties.

- Why it would profit to use this method: 
It's okay if predictors are highly correlated, avoids overfitting and manages model complexity.

- How: 
Log transformed all numeric predictors (and the response variable)
Dummy encoded the factorable variables: Genre, Region, Rating and Season

Performed 10 fold cross-validation and let that select lambda and alpha values. 





- Strongest predictors:

- Moderate Predictors:

- Predictors that shrunk to 0:
